.SH "NAME"
mkvinfo \- Print information about elements in Matroska(TM) files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmkvinfo\fR\ 'u
\fBmkvinfo\fR [options] {source\-filename}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program lists all elements contained in a
Matroska(TM)\&. The output can be limited to a list of tracks in the file including information about the codecs used\&.
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
.RS 4
By default
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
stops when it encounters the first cluster\&. Additionally it doesn\*(Aqt show certain often occurring elements\&. With this option
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will continue processing regardless of the verbosity level and show all elements\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-checksums\fR
.RS 4
Calculates and display the
\fBAdler\-32\fR
checksum for each frame\&. Useful for debugging only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-continue\fR
.RS 4
By default
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
stops when it encounters the first cluster\&. With this option
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will continue processing regardless of the verbosity level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-hex\-positions\fR
.RS 4
Show the positions of all elements in hexadecimal regardless of the verbosity level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-positions\fR
.RS 4
Show the positions of all elements in decimal regardless of the verbosity level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-summary\fR
.RS 4
Only show a terse summary of what
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
finds and not each element\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-track\-info\fR
.RS 4
Show statistics for each track in verbose mode\&. Also sets verbosity to 1 if it was at level 0 before\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-hexdump\fR
.RS 4
Show the first 16 bytes of each frame as a hex dump\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-full\-hexdump\fR
.RS 4
Show all bytes of each frame as a hex dump\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-size\fR
.RS 4
Show the size of each element including its header\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-command\-line\-charset\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to convert strings given on the command line from\&. It defaults to the character set given by system\*(Aqs current locale\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-output\-charset\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to which strings are converted that are to be output\&. It defaults to the character set given by system\*(Aqs current locale\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-redirect\-output\fR \fIfile\-name\fR
.RS 4
Writes all messages to the file
\fIfile\-name\fR
instead of to the console\&. While this can be done easily with output redirection there are cases in which this option is needed: when the terminal reinterprets the output before writing it to a file\&. The character set set with
\fB\-\-output\-charset\fR
is honored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ui\-language\fR \fIcode\fR
.RS 4
Forces the translations for the language
\fIcode\fR
to be used (e\&.g\&. \*(Aqde_DE\*(Aq for the German translations)\&. Entering \*(Aqlist\*(Aq as the
\fIcode\fR
will cause the program to output a list of available translations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-abort\-on\-warnings\fR
.RS 4
Tells the program to abort after the first warning is emitted\&. The program\*(Aqs exit code will be 1\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR \fItopic\fR
.RS 4
Turn on debugging for a specific feature\&. This option is only useful for developers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-engage\fR \fIfeature\fR
.RS 4
Turn on experimental features\&. A list of available features can be requested with
\fBmkvinfo \-\-engage list\fR\&. These features are not meant to be used in normal situations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-gui\-mode\fR
.RS 4
Turns on GUI mode\&. In this mode specially\-formatted lines may be output that can tell a controlling GUI what\*(Aqs happening\&. These messages follow the format \*(Aq#GUI#message\*(Aq\&. The message may be followed by key/value pairs as in \*(Aq#GUI#message#key1=value1#key2=value2\&...\*(Aq\&. Neither the messages nor the keys are ever translated and always output in English\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Be more verbose\&. See the section about
verbosity levels
for a description which information will be output at which level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show usage information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Show version information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB@\fR\fIoptions\-file\&.json\fR
.RS 4
Reads additional command line arguments from the file
\fIoptions\-file\fR\&. For a full explanation on the supported formats for such files see the section called "Option files" in the
\fBmkvmerge\fR(1)
man page\&.
.RE
.SH "VERBOSITY LEVELS"
.PP
The
\fB\-v\fR
option can be used to increase
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)\*(Aqs verbosity level and print more information about the current file\&.
.PP
At level 0
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will print only the track headers it finds and their types\&.
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will exit as soon as the headers are parsed completely (more technical: as soon as the first cluster is encountered)\&. In this level the seek head entries and the cues will not be displayed \-\- even if they\*(Aqre located in front of the track information\&.
.PP
At level 1
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will also print all
Matroska(TM)
elements encountered for the complete file but the seek head entries and the cue entries\&. If the summary mode is enabled then
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will output the frame position as well\&.
.PP
The same effect can be achieved with the option
\fB\-\-continue\fR\&.
.PP
At level 2
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will also print the seek head entries, the cue entries and the file position at which each
Matroska(TM)
element can be found at\&.
.PP
The same effect can be achieved with the options
\fB\-\-all \-\-positions\fR\&.
.PP
At level 3 and above
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
will print some information that is not directly connected to a
Matroska(TM)
element\&. All other elements only print stuff about the elements that were just found\&. Level 3 adds meta information to ease debugging (read: it\*(Aqs intended for developers only)\&. All lines written by level 3 are enclosed in square brackets to make filtering them out easy\&.
.SH "TEXT FILES AND CHARACTER SET CONVERSIONS"
.PP
For an in\-depth discussion about how all tools in the MKVToolNix suite handle character set conversions, input/output encoding, command line encoding and console encoding please see the identically\-named section in the
\fBmkvmerge\fR(1)
man page\&.
.SH "EXIT CODES"
.PP
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
exits with one of three exit codes:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB0\fR
\-\- This exit code means that the run has completed successfully\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB1\fR
\-\- In this case
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
has output at least one warning, but the run did continue\&. A warning is prefixed with the text \*(AqWarning:\*(Aq\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB2\fR
\-\- This exit code is used after an error occurred\&.
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
aborts right after outputting the error message\&. Error messages range from wrong command line arguments over read/write errors to broken files\&.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBmkvinfo\fR(1)
uses the default variables that determine the system\*(Aqs locale (e\&.g\&.
\fILANG\fR
and the
\fILC_*\fR
family)\&. Additional variables:
.PP
\fIMKVINFO_DEBUG\fR, \fIMKVTOOLNIX_DEBUG\fR and its short form \fIMTX_DEBUG\fR
.RS 4
The content is treated as if it had been passed via the
\fB\-\-debug\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMKVINFO_ENGAGE\fR, \fIMKVTOOLNIX_ENGAGE\fR and its short form \fIMTX_ENGAGE\fR
.RS 4
The content is treated as if it had been passed via the
\fB\-\-engage\fR
option\&.
