.SH "NAME"
mkvextract \- extract tracks from Matroska(TM) files into other files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmkvextract\fR\ 'u
\fBmkvextract\fR {source\-filename} {mode1} [options] [extraction\-spec1] [mode2] [options] [extraction\-spec2] [\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program extracts specific parts from a
Matroska(TM)
file to other useful formats\&. The first argument is the name of the source file which must be a
Matroska(TM)
file\&.
.PP
All other arguments either switch to a certain extraction mode, change options for the currently active mode or specify what to extract into which file\&. Multiple modes can be used in the same invocation of mkvextract allowing the extraction of multiple things in a single pass\&. Most options can only be used in certain modes with a few options applying to all modes\&.
.PP
Currently supported is the extraction of
tracks,
tags,
attachments,
chapters,
CUE sheets,
timestamps
and
cues\&.
.SS "Common options"
.PP
The following options are available in all modes and only described once in this section\&.
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-parse\-fully\fR
.RS 4
Sets the parse mode to \*(Aqfull\*(Aq\&. The default mode does not parse the whole file but uses the meta seek elements for locating the required elements of a source file\&. In 99% of all cases this is enough\&. But for files that do not contain meta seek elements or which are damaged the user might have to use this mode\&. A full scan of a file can take a couple of minutes while a fast scan only takes seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-command\-line\-charset\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to convert strings given on the command line from\&. It defaults to the character set given by system\*(Aqs current locale\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-output\-charset\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to which strings are converted that are to be output\&. It defaults to the character set given by system\*(Aqs current locale\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-redirect\-output\fR \fIfile\-name\fR
.RS 4
Writes all messages to the file
\fIfile\-name\fR
instead of to the console\&. While this can be done easily with output redirection there are cases in which this option is needed: when the terminal reinterprets the output before writing it to a file\&. The character set set with
\fB\-\-output\-charset\fR
is honored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-flush\-on\-close\fR
.RS 4
Tells the program to flush all data cached in memory to storage when closing files opened for writing\&. This can be used to prevent data loss on power outages or to circumvent certain problems in the operating system or drivers\&. The downside is that multiplexing will take longer as mkvmerge will wait until all data has been written to the storage before exiting\&. See issues #2469 and #2480 on the MKVToolNix bug tracker for in\-depth discussions on the pros and cons\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ui\-language\fR \fIcode\fR
.RS 4
Forces the translations for the language
\fIcode\fR
to be used (e\&.g\&. \*(Aqde_DE\*(Aq for the German translations)\&. Entering \*(Aqlist\*(Aq as the
\fIcode\fR
will cause the program to output a list of available translations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-abort\-on\-warnings\fR
.RS 4
Tells the program to abort after the first warning is emitted\&. The program\*(Aqs exit code will be 1\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR \fItopic\fR
.RS 4
Turn on debugging for a specific feature\&. This option is only useful for developers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-engage\fR \fIfeature\fR
.RS 4
Turn on experimental features\&. A list of available features can be requested with
\fBmkvextract \-\-engage list\fR\&. These features are not meant to be used in normal situations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-gui\-mode\fR
.RS 4
Turns on GUI mode\&. In this mode specially\-formatted lines may be output that can tell a controlling GUI what\*(Aqs happening\&. These messages follow the format \*(Aq#GUI#message\*(Aq\&. The message may be followed by key/value pairs as in \*(Aq#GUI#message#key1=value1#key2=value2\&...\*(Aq\&. Neither the messages nor the keys are ever translated and always output in English\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Be verbose and show all the important
Matroska(TM)
elements as they\*(Aqre read\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show usage information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Show version information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB@\fR\fIoptions\-file\&.json\fR
.RS 4
Reads additional command line arguments from the file
\fIoptions\-file\fR\&. For a full explanation on the supported formats for such files see the section called "Option files" in the
\fBmkvmerge\fR(1)
man page\&.

.PP
The following command line options are available for each track in the \*(Aqtracks\*(Aq extraction mode\&. They have to appear in front of the track specification (see below) they should be applied to\&.
.PP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to convert the next text subtitle track to\&. Only valid if the next track ID targets a text subtitle track\&. It defaults to UTF\-8\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-blockadd\fR \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Keep only the BlockAdditions up to this level\&. The default is to keep all levels\&. This option only affects certain kinds of codecs like WAVPACK4\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cuesheet\fR
.RS 4
Causes
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
to extract a
CUE
sheet from the chapter information and tag data for the following track into a file whose name is the track\*(Aqs output name with \*(Aq\&.cue\*(Aq appended to it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-raw\fR
.RS 4
Extracts the raw data into a file without any container data around it\&. Unlike the
\fB\-\-fullraw\fR
flag this flag does not cause the contents of the
CodecPrivate
element to be written to the file\&. This mode works with all
CodecIDs, even the ones that
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
doesn\*(Aqt support otherwise, but the resulting files might not be usable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fullraw\fR
.RS 4
Extracts the raw data into a file without any container data around it\&. The contents of the
CodecPrivate
element will be written to the file first if the track contains such a header element\&. This mode works with all
CodecIDs, even the ones that
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
doesn\*(Aqt support otherwise, but the resulting files might not be usable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fITID:outname\fR
.RS 4
Causes extraction of the track with the ID
\fITID\fR
into the file
\fIoutname\fR
if such a track exists in the source file\&. This option can be given multiple times\&. The track IDs are the same as the ones output by
\fBmkvmerge\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-identify\fR
option\&.
.sp
Each output name should be used only once\&. The exception are RealAudio and RealVideo tracks\&. If you use the same name for different tracks then those tracks will be saved in the same file\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

.PP
\fIAID\fR:\fIoutname\fR
.RS 4
Causes extraction of the attachment with the ID
\fIAID\fR
into the file
\fIoutname\fR
if such an attachment exists in the source file\&. If the
\fIoutname\fR

.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-simple\fR
.RS 4
Exports the chapter information in the simple format used in the
OGM
tools (CHAPTER01=\&.\&.\&., CHAPTER01NAME=\&.\&.\&.)\&. In this mode some information has to be discarded\&. Default is to output the chapters in
XML
format\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-simple\-language\fR \fIlanguage\fR
.RS 4
If the simple format is enabled then
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
will only output a single entry for each chapter atom encountered even if a chapter atom contains more than one chapter name\&. By default
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
will use the first chapter name found for each atom regardless of its language\&.
.sp
Using this option allows the user to determine which chapter names are output if atoms contain more than one chapter name\&. The
\fIlanguage\fR
parameter must be an ISO 639\-1 or ISO 639\-2 code\&.
.RE
